## About The Project

The Problem
Food fraud and missing traceability drain billions from Indonesian agricultural sector. Farmers cannot prove premium quality (e.g., organic), and buyers cannot verify authenticity, hurting trust and revenue.

Our Hedera-Based Solution
AgroDex creates a digital twin (NFT) for every batch, audited by AI and anchored to Hedera for an immutable trail of evidence.

## Hedera Integration Summary (Required)
We chose Hedera because predictable, low fees are the only sustainable option for low-margin Indonesian logistics.

Hedera Services Utilized
Hedera Consensus Service (HCS): Every “proof” event (planting, harvest, etc.) is submitted via TopicMessageSubmitTransaction to our topic ID, producing a low-cost (~$0.0001) immutable audit log.
Hedera Token Service (HTS): We mint the final certificate as a unique NFT using TokenCreateTransaction.HCS transaction IDs are embedded in the NFT metadata, binding the asset to its evidence trail.
Mirror Nodes: The Verify page queries Mirror Nodes (via the SDK) to replay the HCS history and demonstrate authenticity to judges and buyers.
Economic Justification
Adoption in Indonesia demands sub-$1 fees per transaction. Hedera’s fixed, negligible HCS pricing lets us log thousands of events for a few dollars, keeping the business model viable.

## Key Features
## Traceability (Hedera)
- HCS Logging: Capture every lifecycle event on Hedera Consensus Service.
- HTS Tokenization: Mint NFT certificates that reference the HCS history.
- Verification: Buyers validate authenticity by reading the full Mirror Node history.
## Intelligence (Gemini AI)
- Audit & Trust Score: AI reviews the HCS timeline to produce a 0–100 trust score.
- Bilingual Summaries: Generates provenance summaries in English.
- Buyer Q&A Chatbot: Buyers “talk” to the batch history; AI answers with cited HCS transaction IDs.
- Dashboard Insight: AI provides real-time business insights that surface on the main dashboard.
